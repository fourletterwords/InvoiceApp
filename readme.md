## Project purpose

This project is an exercise to apply and improve upon my abilities as a full-stack developer.
Part of my responsbilities at my current position is managing hardware/software purchasing and is
currently using an inefficient and buggy spreadsheet solution. Having access to a lightweight,
browser-based application will save me hours a week.
